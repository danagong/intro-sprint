# Introductory Workshops
A workshop series for the [Cornell Data Journal](https://cornelldatajourn.al/)

The main documents are Jupyter notebooks that walk you through how to start cleaning, visualizing, and scraping data. 

You can open and run this the first workshop in the cloud by launching Binder (click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/danagong/intro-sprint/main) to launch it!)
